Each line describing a room's exits and possibly warp like this:

<linear room index> <entrance> = <reachable exits>
Be careful to put exactly one space between each item (no tabs or other, no leading spaces).
The linear room index is an integer between 0 and map width * map height, exclusively. The <entrance> must be one of the following: north, south, west, east.
The reachable exits are either empty or a combination of n, s, w, e (for north, south, east, west).
A sample line would look like

39 north = nsw

meaning: "From the northern entrance, you can reach the exits to the north, south and west."

You need only describe existing connections; lines of the form

7 west = 

may be left out.

Teleport lines are of the format
<linear room index> teleport = <teleport entrance> <linear room index of target room> <teleport exit>
e.g.
62 teleport = n 12 w

Meaning: "The teleport of room 62 can be entered by all entrances accessible from the north entrance (including, of course, the north entrance).
It will take you to the western exit of room 12 (of course, the western exit won't be used immediately; it merely determines which exits you can now
use to leave room 12)."
